# Reflex
The trainable AntiCheat that learns your rules - for Minecraft Spigot/Bukkit

# About
Version 1 of The Reflex project was started in May of 2016, with the idea of a lagless solution for Minecraft servers.
As of April 24, 2017 version 2 has begun development.  A new check system has been introduced and continues to follow the idea of a performance-oriented solution to this day.

Reflex is still unfinished, and being developed.

The lead developer on the project is Jonah Seguin (username Shawckz).

This project uses the 1TBS indent style, meaning braces are always used even when not necessary.
For example:
`
if(something) {
doSomething();
}
`
